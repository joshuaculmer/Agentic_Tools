# Anagram Message Decoding

I have an anagram for you that I think starts with what and ends with up, what do you think it says? I know that letters have not been moved beyond the boundary of its initial word, for example: leylowsedre -> yellowdress. You will have to rearrange the letters within each word and determine what each word is.

Valididate that your solution and demonstrate reasoning.
