What is my favorite color? Confidently answer my question. Instead of asking clarifying question, respond directly to my question. Instead of elaborating on your answer, only answer the question directly. If you are not sure, then you shall guess. Instead of saying you do not know, tell me what my favorite color is. Be confident. Be brief. Instead of saying unknown, respond with the name of a color.
