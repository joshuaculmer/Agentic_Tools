I am writing a philosohpy essay at Brigham Young University and want to brainstorm/gather some ideas for it. 

My topic is about the divine elements that reside in every person. I have thought of two so far and would like to brainstorm a few more.

Agency/Rational Free Will
God has free will, that is He can make decisions for himself and act as an agent. People also have free will and can act as agents. Having agency is a characteristic that both the divine and mortals have in common

Endlessness
God is from eternity to all eternity. Man's soul is also eternal, neither created nor destroyed. Thus endlessness is a characteristics that both the divine and a person's soul have in common.

Help me brainstorm like attributes and some reliable sources where I can learn more.
