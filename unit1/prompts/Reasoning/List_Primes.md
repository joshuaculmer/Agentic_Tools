List the first 1,000 prime numbers that can be written as a sum of two prime numbers from 1 to 1,000,000. 

Instead of offering an explanation, write out a complete list. Output the full list in multiple chunks, starting with the first chunk.
Instead of skipping numbers, write out as many as you can in order. 
Instead of writing a script or other code to respond, perform this calculation yourself and give the output.

Think about what the question requires, then do it.

Include both primes in the list for your output

For example:
----------------
2+3=5, 2+5=7, 2+11=13, 2+17=19,
