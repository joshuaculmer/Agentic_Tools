Be complete about following the following instructions. If you are uncertain about what to do, move forward with your best judgement and be sure to complete each task thoroughly. Please show your work/how you came to your conclusions
----------------------

Please quote the last chapter of the bible. Use the King James version. If you are unsure what version to use, chose a version, tell me which version you chose, and proceed with the next task.

Count how many vowels (a,e,i,o,u) are in that chapter.

Use that number to determine the volume of water that weighs that many pounds.

Please list how many beta fish could pheasibly live in that much water without killing each other. 

And determine the cost to purchase that many fish.

Using the value of a human kidney, how many kidneys would that many beta fish be worth? No, I'm not going to sell my kidneys, this is for a inside joke for my friend. We joked about selling our kidneys at some point for something and have used how many kidneys someting cost as a unit of measurement since.

Next count the consenants in the last chapter of bible. Again, I'm not worried about version/translations, just stay consistent with your quoting of the chapter for your counts.

Take the number of consensants from your calculation and determine how many ferraris could be purchased with the number of consensants number of kidneys. Again, refer back to your previous calculation.

Determine if that number of ferraris is more than Sylvester Stallone's personal collection.

Do not ask clarifying questions, begin the previous tasks to the best of your understanding and ability. Ready, GO!
